# generator-alfred-python

> Generator to scaffold out a new Alfred workflow using python

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-alfred-python using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-alfred-python
```

Create a new blank workflow in Alfred and open that workflow in terminal or navigate to it.

Then generate your new workflow in that directory:

```bash
yo alfred-python
```

Refer to [Alfred-Workflow](https://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/index.html) documentation for how to continue developing your new workflow.
